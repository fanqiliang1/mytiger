# for codegen option

## compile to C programming language

use

    $ java Tiger -codegen C T.java

the program will compile to C and generate C file under "/tmp/" (so this won't work in Windows system, only after you changed the path in codegen.C.PrettyPrintVisitor.java).

if you want compile to executable directly you could use following command:

    $ java Tiger -codegen C T.java -auto

## compile to java byte code

use

    $ java Tiger -codegen bytecode T.java

and it will generate some *.j file in your current working directory, then
compile *.j into class file using:

    $ java -jar ../jasmin.jar *.j

this will generate *.class file in your current working directory, run the
program using

    $ java Main

replace Main with your class with main method.
